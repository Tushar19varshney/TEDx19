                Since the beginning of time, humans have been surrounded by
                constraints and challenged with the task to overcome them. A
                huge part of our evolution revolves around these constraints.
                Although culture and tradition have provided us with a basis for
                living standards, they have held us back in many ways. Going
                against the tradition is not to be viewed as a step in the wrong
                direction, but rather as an attempt at a new, unexplored
                adventure. This year, TEDxIITRoorkee is focused on encouraging
                people to go against the flow and try out new ventures, and also
                guide them along their journey.
